Finding Lane lines on a road
The folder contains the following files:
P1-vm.ipynb : This is a iPython notebook created using Jupyter. It contains the code and test cases demonstarting and testing the working of the code. The code has been developed using the example in the Udacity Self-driving car Nanodegree course https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/syllabus/core-curriculum
The images and videos in the folder test_images, examples, test_videos are obtained from https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1 .
The folder test_code demonstartes the working of the helper functions.
The folder test_images_out contains the images generated by the code in P1-vm.ipynb. These output images are named by adding an 'output' suffix to the corresponding images from the folder test_images which are used as input.
Similarly the folder test_videos_output contains the output videos generated using the code in P1-vm.ipynb
A writeup describing the working of the code and reflections on potential improvements is in 'Project Writeup - Finding Lanes on a Road - Vin M - 2017-09.pdf'
